# THE IDEA
I am a javascript developer, (Next.js, Gatsby, GraphQL, Prisma, Loopback) But sometimes loosing time on fancy technologies is my first mistake. As a developer I love to bootstrap few side projects by year, sometimes its for my own knowledges, sometimes its for making money, but sincerely, I am tired to develop the same things all the time. Let's help each other and develop a django style framework for Node.


# PHILOSOPHY
From Beginners to experts.
Code lesser, ship faster.

# GOALS
Get things done faster! Build reusable apps, and bootstrap projects in hours not in weeks or month.
